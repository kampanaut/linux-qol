# linux-qol

A repository for my linux scripts for the sake of quality of life.

`.globals` file is put inside your home directory.

`tmux-scripts` as of now contains scripts mainly for automating sessions management.
`project-handler` contains scripts for creating and deleting projects.

`ssh-it` is a script for managing ssh agents so that it's easy to pull or push to 
github repositories in SSH.

`takbo` is just a script for jumping to project directory.

`project-handler` and `tmux-scripts` use the `.globals` script for looking up my define 
project directories.
